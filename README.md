MasonX/Interp/WithCallbacks version 1.20
========================================

[![ðŸ§… CPAN version](https://badge.fury.io/pl/MasonX-Interp-WithCallbacks.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/pl/MasonX-Interp-WithCallbacks)
[![âœ… Build Status](https://github.com/theory/masonx-interp-withcallbacks/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/theory/masonx-interp-withcallbacks/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks subclasses HTML::Mason::Interp in order to
provide a [Mason] callback system built on [Params::CallbackRequest].
Callbacks may be either code references provided to the `new()` constructor,
or methods defined in subclasses of [Params::Callback]. Callbacks are triggered
either for every request or by specially named keys in the Mason request
arguments, and all callbacks are executed at the beginning of a request, just
before Mason creates and executes the request component stack.

This module brings support for a sort of plugin architecture based on
Params::CallbackRequest to Mason. Mason then executes code before executing
any components. This approach allows you to carry out logical processing of
data submitted from a form, to affect the contents of the Mason request
arguments (and thus the `%ARGS` hash in components), and even to redirect or
abort the request before Mason handles it.
